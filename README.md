## Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is called when the EA is initialized. In this function, necessary parameters for the EA are set, such as selecting the trading symbol (in this case, 'GBPUSD').

## Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is deinitialized. This function is used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

## Trading Logic
The main trading logic of the EA is implemented in the `OnTick()` function, which is called on each tick. The following steps are performed in the `OnTick()` function:

1. Execute buy and sell orders based on the trading strategy.
2. Set appropriate stop loss and take profit levels for each trade.
3. Manage trade positions, including adjusting stop loss and take profit levels as necessary.
4. Monitor and manage open trades, including closing positions based on predetermined conditions.
5. Implement risk management features, such as position sizing and risk-reward ratios.
